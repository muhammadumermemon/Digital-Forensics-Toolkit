<h1>Secure Access Control System</h1>

<p>A comprehensive and secure access control system designed to provide robust security and access management for various applications.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This system utilizes a combination of password hashing, verification, and secure database connection to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Password hashing using MD5 algorithm to ensure secure password storage</li>
<li>Password verification to ensure that the entered password matches the stored hash</li>
<li>Secure database connection using Indy library to prevent SQL injection attacks</li>
<li>Input validation to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity</li>
<li>Multi-level access control to ensure that users can only access authorized resources</li>
<li>Audit logging to track all system activities and ensure accountability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Delphi IDE for development and compilation</li>
<li>MySQL database for storing user credentials and system data</li>
<li>Indy library for secure database connection and communication</li>
<li>Windows operating system for deployment and execution</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or another version control system.</li>
<li>Open the project in Delphi IDE and compile the code to generate the executable file.</li>
<li>Configure the database connection settings by modifying the database connection string and credentials.</li>
<li>Run the application and follow the prompts to set up the system and create user accounts.</li>
<li>Deploy the system to the production environment and ensure that all security measures are in place.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
